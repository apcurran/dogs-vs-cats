## Features:

- CSS Grid used for article layout

- Fully-reponsive (including h1 font-size) without any media queries

- Mobile-friendly

This was a good opportunity to experiment with overlapping elements (h1 in this example) with grid.  Also, I wanted to create a simple, yet pleasing layout without utilizing any media queries.
